# FDiagram
Tool for managing fishing diagrams and BHAs
## Printing

Use the **Print PDF** button on the builder page to generate an A4 image.
The printout now renders at roughly 400 DPI and is printed from a hidden
iframe so no extra browser windows are opened.

## External drawings

When uploading PDF drawings as assemblies the pages are now rendered at a
higher resolution before being added to your BHA. This results in clearer
images when exporting or printing your assemblies.
