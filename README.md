## Printing

Use the **Print PDF** button on the builder page to generate an A4 image.
The printout now renders at roughly 300 DPI and is printed from a hidden
iframe so no extra browser windows are opened.

## Scaling

On the builder page use the **Scale Up** and **Scale Down** buttons to adjust
the size of every component on the canvas. Each click changes the component
scale by 10%. Assemblies remember the active scale so any components you drop
later use the same size as the rest of the assembly.
